# Hand-gesture-recognition

In this sign language recognition project, we create a sign detector, which detects hand
gestures that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs gestures .We
have developed this project using OpenCV and python.

In day-to-day life, hand gesture recognition is one of the system that can detect the gesture of
hands in a real time video. The gesture of hand is classify within a certain area of interest.
Designing a system for hand gesture recognition is one of the goal of achieving the objectives
of this project. The task of recognizing hand gestures is one of the main and important issues
in computer vision. With the latest advances in information and media technology, human
computer interaction (HCI) systems that involve hand processing tasks such as hand detection
and hand gesture recognition

The first step in any hand processing system is to detect and locate the hand in the real-time
video from the webcam. The detection of hand is challenging because of variation in pose,
orientation, location and scale. Also, different intensity of light in the room adds to the
variability. In the process of detection of hand gesture recognition generally involves multiple
levels such as image acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction and gesture recognition.
Image acquisition involves capturing image in the video frame by frame using a webcam.
The captured images go through the image pre-processing process which involves color
filtering, smoothing and thresholding. Feature extraction is a method that involves extracting
features of the hand image such as hand contours while gesture recognition is a method to
recognize hand gesture by extracting the features.


In this study, designing hand gesture recognition is one of the complicated jobs that involves
two major problems. Firstly is the detection of the hand. User hand is detected by using a
webcam in real-time video. The problem would be the unstable brightness, noise, poor
resolution and contrast. The detected hand in the video are recognized to identify the
gestures. At this stage, the process involved the segmentation and edge detection with various
information of image like color, hand posture and shape based (shape of hand) in a real time
would affect the recognition of gestures. Another problem is to create the sign that is suitable
to be used one hand at a time. The extraction of the hand need to be followed to determine
each number and sign used; the extraction of the hand involves the contour and convexity
defects. Convexity defect gives an issue on how to calculate the depth of the defects. Some of
the defects have far greater depth than others so to identify the depth would include some
equations
